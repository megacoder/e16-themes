StarEnli-DR16
-------------

Welcome to StarEnli-DR16 for Enlightenment.  This theme is based on the
theme StarEnli-0.13, written by Canin <http://www.canin.tel.debica.pl/>.
The aim in creating StarEnli-DR16 was to take the best elements of
StarEnli-0.13, improve what could be improved, add some useful borders and
features such as epplet and Eterm support, and, most importantly, make the
theme Enlightenment DR16 compliant.

Apart from the changes to its visual appearance, in terms of file
arrangement and content the theme is _considerably_ different from
StarEnli-0.13, which is why I have renamed it.  So please do not do
anything silly like rename this theme to the old one; keep it and its files
separate from StarEnli-0.13 if you already have it.  In any case, no
responsibility is taken for what the use of this theme might do to your
desktop, machine or anything else.  This theme is released under the terms
of the GNU General Public License, which can be found in the file COPYING.

Changes from 0.13
-----------------

Some of the features and improvements of StarEnli-DR16 include the
following:

- properly DR16 compliant.
- support for epplets and Eterm auto theme (Eterm 0.9).
- reduced size of the menu, exit and slideout buttons; they also now slide
  left not down, and have been reordered according to my perception of the
  frequency of their use (eg. iconify, stick and shade come first).
- iconify button is always on title bar (no need to use slideout menu).
- `tooltips' for pager and iconbox so you can see what program the mini is
  an icon for. 
- new borders including FIXED_SIZE, SHAPED, RIGHT_PAGER, SIDE, SIDE_HEADER
  and TRANSIENT.  NB, most of these are based on old borders from the
  StarEnli-0.13 theme or snapshot of 01/01/00, but have been changed,
  improved and/or renamed to better reflect their usage (see ChangeLog for
  more details).
- nicer looking cursors.
- better tooltips (the theme now (generally) uses the default ones instead
  of self-defined ones).  
- change of colour to indicate sticky window.  
- myriad other changes which are outlined in more detail (if more
  chaotically) in the ChangeLog.

Eterms
------

If you run Eterm -t auto while running StarEnli-DR16, your Eterms should
have a nice StarEnli-style appearance.  I chose the starry image as a
background because I figured it was reasonably inoffensive but if you are
like me and have a rather low tolerance for backgrounds in your Eterms, you
should put a script called user.cfg in the following directory:

~/.Eterm/themes/auto/   (where ~ = your home directory)

The user.cfg file should look something like this:

<Eterm-0.9>
begin main
 begin imageclasses
   begin image
         type background
         mode solid allow trans image viewport auto
         state normal
         border 0 0 0 0
   end image
 end imageclasses 
end main

This has the effect of overriding any background image and making the
background solid black instead.  Well, at least on my machine it does.. :)
Of course, any other changes you want to make to your auto theme
configuration can go in the same file.  See any Eterm theme.cfg file to see
what other Eterm features you can configure.

Gtk and .Xdefaults
------------------

Gtk and Xdefaults themes for StarEnli are currently available from Canin's
website:

http://www.canin.tel.debica.pl/linux/starenli/

I use the StarEnli gtk theme written by Oliver Borowiak available at the
above site.

Once I have put my improved versions up they will be available from: 

http://www.flea.org/starenli/

To Do
-----

- Improve appearance of some of the curved border images if possible.
- fix .Xdefaults and gtk themes.
- make the navigator console not shown by default
- support putting the navigator console in any of the four corners (or
  anywhere) on the screen.

Bugs
----

- If you change from a DEFAULT to a SIDE border, if the title of the window
  is too long the text will go over the edge of the black background.
  Since the SIDE border is mainly there to be used with The Gimp, it
  shouldn't be a big issue but I would like to fix this nonetheless.
- If you resize a DEFAULT border horizontally sometimes the black text
  background starts to stick out the other size of the exit button.  I've
fixed it a little but it still happens inconsistently.

Hope you enjoy the theme,
