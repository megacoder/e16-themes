				EVOLUTION

			Enlightenment v0.16
_____________________________________________________


Thanks for choosing the Evolution Theme for Enlightenment! 
It is my sincere hope that you enjoy Evolution and continue
to use it long after you try it out for the first time.

Design goals for this theme:  Evolution was initiallly 
prompted by my desire to create a predominantly flat 
interface that only hints at depth.  In addition, I was 
becoming somewhat weary of the parade of moody themes 
that were being released and sought to build a theme that
would be easy on the eyes yet possess some pleasing color
saturation.

You can get further help by clicking the "About this theme"
item in your root menu.

I will soon be posting the Evolution GTK theme to gtk.themes.org
as well as the Evolution theme for GKrellm to www.muhri.net.  
If you like Evolution, check these sites for the rest of the pie.

Feel free to mail any comments, questions & suggestions to
the author at chris.lennert@shawgrp.com.

				    Enjoy,

			 		Christopher Lennert
