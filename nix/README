   I've re-written most of this theme to conform with the latest trend;
the seperation of everything into seperate directories is much cleaner and 
easier to find things in. A vast improvement over the previous philosopy.



/*
     Ok. This theme is somewhat thicker than most. It all began as an early
release of hoax's BlueHeart theme, that didn't have a fully working slideout.
So I started editing the .cfg files. Then I found an equally blue theme on
Litestep.net that kicked ass, and I figured hell, enough LS themes are
ports of E themes....why not port a worthy LS theme to Enlightenment? So
this is basically nIxStep blue, a theme by "nIx" aka Lee Nichols, who can be
 contacted @ lnichols@netcomuk.co.uk  or  e.s.c@netcomuk.co.uk 
 - ported with permission

      To customize this theme to suit your needs you no longer need to make your own pixmaps; all you have to do is edit 3 files; actionclasses.cfg, buttons.cfg, and slideouts.cfg. Just add a new actionclass for what you want executed, add in a new button in the appropriate location in buttons.cfg, using a new label and don't forget to point it to your new actionclass. Then add the button name in slideouts.cfg in the EXACT posisition you want.
      
             You're going to need an example, arn't you? Very well...pay attention.

This is a sufficient actionclass for a new button, 

  __ACLASS __BGN
    __NAME NETSCAPE      <---------------The name of This actionclass
    __TOOLTIP_TEXT "Web Browser" <-------What appears as the tooltip
    __TYPE __TYPE_NORMAL
    __EVENT __MOUSE_RELEASE
    __ALLOW_ANY_MODIFIER_KEYS __ON
    __BUTTON 1
    __ACTION __A_EXEC netscape   <-------The command 
  __END



 Then define the new item in buttons.cfg (since the edit, this should now be done in ???????????????????????????????
 
 __BUTTON __BGN
  __NAME NETSCAPE   <------------The name of the button (to go in slideouts.cfg)
  __ICLASS F_BLANK 
  __ACLASS NETSCAPE  <-----------The actionclass You just defined
  __TCLASS BUTTON_TEXT  <--------BUTTON_TEXT2 is slightly smaller
  __LABEL "Netscape" <-----------Button text (big words are tough to fit)
  __MIN_WIDTH 55
  __MAX_WIDTH 55
  __MIN_HEIGHT 55
  __MAX_HEIGHT 55
  __KEEP_ON_TOP __ON
  __USE_SIZE_OF_IMAGE __ON
  __MAKE_STICKY __ON
__END

       
 And then just add the button in whatever slideout you desire;

__SLIDEOUT __BGN
   __NAME SLIDE_INTERNET
   __SLIDE_DIRECTION __LEFT
   __BUTTON RIGHTEND2
   __BUTTON PPP
   __BUTTON NETSCAPE  <------------Posistioning determined here.
   __BUTTON TKRAT
   __BUTTON XCHAT
   __BUTTON GTKICQ
   __BUTTON GHX2
   __BUTTON LICQ
   __BUTTON LEFTEND2
__END

   There. That's it. Easy to configure, and no more mis-matched pixmap fonts: Thankx to Christian Kreibich (kreibich@informatik.tu-muenchen.de) for the tip on text labels, which made this theme alot easier to customize.


 Yeah I got crazy one night and was thinking about how classic those
borders were in DR9(?) and just threw them in this theme because I thought
they's look better blue then orange when highlited. This theme is just
thrown together from others anyway...


Latest update: just some more small changes, notibally the "log" function
that is in the system menu. Basically just a usefull function that
everyone probably uses, built into the etheme. If anyone has suggestions
for more common commands, email me and I'll throw it in.
