e-chaos is a port for Enlightenment of the chaos blackbox theme 
by artwiz (http://artramp.org). Some graphics were taken from 
chaos for XMMS, by Omar Hussain (http://ohussain.cjb.net/). 
Some widgets, like arrows, scrollbars, check and radio buttons 
are taken from chaos-gtk by JP Bizet (http://jpb.freeyellow.com) 
which were taken from blueHeart-GTK by Chris Fofiu. Also, many 
ideas, fixes, suggestions, pieces of advice, general proddings, 
yadda, yadda, have come from JP, to whom I am eternally grateful. 
The theme goes well with his chaos-gtk theme and n010G1k's chaos 
for gkrellm (http://n0l0g1k.de.st/). 

Thanks to everyone who in some way, helped form this.
